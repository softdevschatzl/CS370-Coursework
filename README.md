## Pirate Intelligent Agent
This project demonstrates the application of reinforcement learning (RL) and neural networks to solve a pathfinding problem through a pirate-themed intelligent agent. The agent learns to navigate a maze to find treasure by using Q-learning, a key algorithm in RL. This project builds on foundational concepts from the course, applying them to a real-world scenario while demonstrating how an intelligent agent can make decisions, learn from experiences, and improve over time.

### Project Code Breakdown
Provided Code:
I was given the framework of the project, which included basic classes like TreasureMaze.py and GameExperience.py. These provided methods for interacting with the maze, resetting the game environment, and managing the agent’s experience replay.
Code I Created:
I implemented the training logic in the qtrain() function, which integrates reinforcement learning concepts with neural networks. This included handling experience replay, managing the epsilon-greedy strategy for balancing exploration and exploitation, and setting training parameters such as epochs and memory size. I also ensured the code outputted relevant logs to monitor the agent’s performance.

## Connecting Learning to Computer Science
Throughout this course, I deepened my understanding of reinforcement learning and its connection to the larger field of artificial intelligence (AI). These skills are essential because computer scientists frequently develop systems that solve real-world problems, such as autonomous navigation or game strategies. By working on this project, I’ve gained hands-on experience with machine learning frameworks and neural networks, understanding how algorithms can teach agents to learn and adapt.

## What Do Computer Scientists Do and Why Does It Matter?
Computer scientists design, develop, and optimize systems that handle complex tasks across industries—from creating efficient algorithms to building secure software and AI models. Their work is crucial to solving pressing challenges in healthcare, transportation, and beyond, such as developing autonomous vehicles, analyzing large datasets, or building intelligent assistants.

## Problem-Solving as a Computer Scientist
As a computer scientist, I approach problems methodically, breaking down complex challenges into smaller, manageable tasks. In this project, I divided the problem into:

Setting up the maze environment.
Configuring training parameters.
Implementing Q-learning logic for the agent.
Monitoring and evaluating performance through metrics like win rate.
This approach ensures that each component works correctly and collectively achieves the desired outcome. Additionally, I learned to iterate on solutions, tuning hyperparameters like memory size and exploration rate to improve results.

## Ethical Responsibilities to the End User and Organization
Developing intelligent agents raises important ethical considerations. My responsibility as a computer scientist is to design fair and unbiased systems that serve the end user’s best interests. For this project, although the focus was on a simulation, the broader application of reinforcement learning must consider fairness, transparency, and accountability. Similarly, I am responsible for ensuring that the systems I build meet the needs of the organization while adhering to legal and ethical standards, such as data privacy regulations.
